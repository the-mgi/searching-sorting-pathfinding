    <p>So, this is just a random blog, can be the one you are looking for right now, or simply not. I actually don't
        know what I am writing and why, just doing so, coz i can :). Let's try to be serious <em>(LOL)</em>. Okay so,
        Right now the blog is empty as you can see, but for future, three blogs are planned</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Firebase OAuth using Github, Twitter, Facebook</li>
        <li>How to add Github Gists in Angular Apps</li>
        <li>Why you should STAY AWAY from Javascript</li>
        <li>Okay so, in Pathfinding Component i tried to create a GRID of small boxes as a base on which i was supposed
            to simulate the algorithms but the issue that i am facing is that the application is getting very heavy and
            stuttering and this is why algorithms are NECESSARY MAN.. Now I am not liking it bruhhhhh..!!!
            Do Something about it Muhammad Usama pilis pilis..!! Think about something bruh..!!

            I'll definitely look into the CLEMENT's code of how he did it.. Most likely i'll get my answer.
            If not, i'll ask him directly on linkedin. in hope of he'll reply someday..!!
