What is an algorithm?
    An algorithm can be defined as the set of instructions that we pass on to th computer to do any task in its COMPUTING LIMITS
    It ranges from simply finding out the LCM of numbers to complex Deep Learning Algorithms such as Logistic Regression

    There are tons of algorithms for Sorting, Searching and Pathfinding, the details of which are given below.

Sorting Algorithms
    What?
        Sorting Algorithms is specifically used to arrange the un-organized elements in a given collection. This arrangement can be based on
        ASCII codes or simply which number is greater than the other on a number line.
    Why?
        It proves to be useful in different areas such as for arranging the Book Catalogue in an online E-Book store or Information of people
        arranged in alphabetical order which is useful for faster retrieval of data from any of these Information Stores.
    Sorting Algorithms?
        Some examples are given below which you can visualize by clicking on any of them.
        => Selection Sort
        => Bubble Sort
        => Quick Sort
        => Merge Sort
        => Radix Sort
        => Bucket Sort
        => Bitonic Sorting
        => Pancake Sorting
