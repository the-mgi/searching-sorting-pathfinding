# A simple Visualizer for ```Patfinding, Searching``` and ```Sorting```
I am basically building this project for ```TechWithTim``` CodeJam, but let's see if this will complete on time or not. If not, than this would be a great project for ```Learning Angular```.

So, CodeJam is over and not completed yet, now I might use this as my Web Engineering Course Project. Hope it completes this time.
