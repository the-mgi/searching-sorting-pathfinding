# A simple Visualizer for ```Patfinding, Searching``` and ```Sorting```
I am basically building this project for ```TechWithTim``` CodeJam, but let's see if this will complete on time or not. If not, than this would be a great project for ```Learning Angular```.

So, CodeJam is over and not completed yet, now I might use this as my Web Engineering Course Project. Hope it completes this time.
i was just hopeful to complete this project on time but Prof. suggested me to some other project to get more hands-on with database, because this was mainly a frontend project, thereby i am going to make another project for course, thereby further development of this might be delayed.
